He is of Russian Jewish descent. At 17, he took his first step towards becoming a stand-up comedian when he spontaneously took the stage at a Boston comedy club. He found he was a natural comic. He nurtured his talent while at New York University (graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1991) by performing regularly in clubs and at universities. During his freshman year, he snagged a recurring role as the Huxtable family's friend Smitty on La hora de Bill Cosby (1984). While working at a comedy club in L.A., he was ""discovered"" by Dennis Miller, who recommended him to Saturday Night Live (1975) producer Lorne Michaels and told him that Sandler had a big talent. This led to his being cast in the show in 1990, which he also wrote for in addition to performing. After Saturday Night Live (1975), Sandler went on to the movies, starring in such hit comedies as Cabezas huecas (1994), Terminagolf (1996), Billy Madison (1995) and Un papá genial (1999). He has also starred in Mr. Deeds (2002) alongside Winona Ryder; Ocho noches locas (2002), an animated movie about the Jewish festival of Chanukah; and Embriagado de amor (2002). He also writes and produces many of his own films and has composed songs for several of them, including El chico ideal (1998). Sandler has had several of his songs placed on the ""Billboard"" charts, including the classic ""The Chanukah Song"".

Maya Rudolph;https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzOTQwMzAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA1OTc0._V1_UX67_CR0,0,67,98_AL_.jpg;"Maya Rudolph was born on July 27, 1972 in Gainesville, Florida, to Richard Rudolph, a music producer, and soul singer Minnie Riperton. Her mother was African-American and her father is Ashkenazi Jewish (from a family from Lithuania, Russia, Germany, and Hungary). In 1973, Maya, her parents, and her older brother, Marc Rudolph, moved to California to further Minnie's music career. Here Minnie recorded ""Lovin' You"", her most famous single, in which one can hear her sing ""Maya, Maya, Maya"" at the end of the song; Riperton said that the song was used as a lullaby for Maya.

During adolescence, Maya attended St. Augustine by the Sea School, where she met childhood friend, Gwyneth Paltrow. The Paltrows and the Rudolphs became family friends and, in 2000, Richard Rudolph and Maya filled the role of music supervisors on the Bruce Paltrow-directed film A dúo (2000), which starred Gwyneth.

In 1990, Maya enrolled at the University of California at Santa Cruz, majoring in photography. It was here that Maya formed the band ""Supersauce"" with fellow students. After graduation in 1994, Maya left the band and soon joined The Rentals, fronted by Weezer bassist Matt Sharp. Maya was featured on the 1999 release ""Seven More Minutes"", where she sang backup vocals on ""Barcelona"" and ""My Head is in the Sun"". Maya began touring with the group, singing backup and playing Moog synthesizer. When The Rentals disbanded, Maya decided to pursue her dream of a career in comedy, joining the famed troupe ""The Groundlings"".

On May 6, 2000, Maya joined the cast of Saturday Night Live (1975), and became one of that show's most popular performers. Famous sketches include a dead-on impression of fashion diva Donatella Versace; high school flake ""Megan"", the host of her own morning talk show, ""Wake-up WakeField""; and one of the members of the R&B parody ""Gemini's Twin"". In 2006, she co-starred in the film El último show (2006), directed by the legendary Robert Altman and based on the NPR show by Garrison Keillor.

Maya has four children with her partner, filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson.
